            <p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; color: #4b0082;">Mahalinguistics is a revolutionary approach to understanding language and its impact on our lives. Founded on the principles outlined in the Mahalinguist Manifesto, we seek to challenge conventional notions of linguistics and language education.</p>

            The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum ... that gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits placed on the range of the debate.<br>

            Language has no independent existence apart from the people who use it... it is a means to an end of understanding who you are and what society is like<br>
